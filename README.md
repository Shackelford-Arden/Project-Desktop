# Project-Desktop

A repo to keep track of the things I use on my workstations :)

## Tools

### Terminal Emulators

#### Wezterm (Current)

Playing with this as one of the new kids on the block. Pretty cool to see that it supports multiple platforms.

Anything else I do with it can be found [in the folder](./wezterm/index.md).
