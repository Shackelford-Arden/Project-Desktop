# Starship

- [Official Site](https://starship.rs/)
- [Current Config](./starship.toml)

Been playing with Starship mostly because I've noticed that my setup of `zshrc` is a little slow sometimes and managing the config is a bit of a pain sometimes. Just curious if Starship manages to make either of those components any easier.
